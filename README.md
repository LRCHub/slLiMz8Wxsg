[00:30.07] I got street smarts and you can't get this out no book
[00:33.15] I can't right my wrongs, but I can still write these hooks

[02:17.18] It's been 30 minutes, I don't feel nothin'
[02:19.89] Oh shit, wait a minute, think I'm startin' to feel somethin'
[02:23.05] Where you get this motherfuckin' pill from?
[02:44.55] 
[02:26.44] Heard they got some sanctions on my name
[02:28.54] Heard they plottin' on my name, heard they bankin' on my name
[02:31.54] I got Lita in this bitch and he might spank it on a lane
[02:34.54] I'm just- what? In the cut, throwin' Franklins on her frame
[02:37.58] I'm a- ayy, I'm a gentleman, I'm generous
[02:40.74] I blow a half a million on you hoes, I'm a feminist

[03:17.98] Nothing's happening on a Wednesday, I don't care, I'm on
[03:21.88] I'm looking for the smoke
[03:23.40] This guy sitting front row, man, poof, who needs that?
[03:27.90] Let me put my window down, I need fresh air
[03:49.40] 
[03:30.46] We don't want that, we want bars
[03:32.83] The reason why we listen to 21 and The Boy
[03:35.26] That's what we do in Paris, we don't do Fashion Week
[03:38.92] Fashion Week, it's for the last decade, it's not for us
[03:43.45] It's about the lights, the lights that we put on in the city
[03:46.75] The lights of the Eiffel Tower
[04:01.75] 
[03:49.18] I'm in charge of it, I'm the one who's putting it on every day
[03:53.17] And you try to flex next, next to me on the red light with your ugly
[03:57.46] Whatever, flexing, most expensive car, V12
[04:01.07] I drive a four-cylinder, I come from nothing
[04:03.66] But I'm doing something and you cannot catch my drive
[04:30.16] 
[04:06.62] As fast as you try to go, you will never catch me, man
[04:10.81] There is only one way, and this way I'm driving, nobody can do it
[04:14.55] I'm Birdman, that's who I am
[04:17.04] In Paris
[04:18.68] Brrt, brrt
